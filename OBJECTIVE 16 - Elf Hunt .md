## PROCEDURE : ##

The hints make this one quite straightforward to complete.  

Upon loading the game and opening developer tools we see that we are given a cookie called `ElfHunt_JWT`.  This cookie looks something like this:
```
eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzcGVlZCI6LTUwMH0.
```

From the objective hints and the name of the cookie we can safely assume that this is a **JSON Web Token (JWT)** and looking at the source code for `main.js` we can see that the JWT is being split into three parts with the â€˜.â€™ Acting as a delimiter.  
The inline comments conveniently let us know that the second part contains the payload.

```
function parseJwtPayload(token) {
  // Split the JWT into its three parts
  const parts = token.split('.');
  // The payload is the second part. We decode it from base64 and parse the JSON
  try {
```

We can also notice that there is nothing after the second â€˜.â€™, which means that this JWT has no signature and therefore we should be able to modify the payload however we like.

By copying the middle part of the JWT; `eyJzcGVlZCI6LTUwMH0` and using [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to decode from `base64` we find that the payload consists of the following JSON value:
**`{"speed":-500}`**

We can simply modify this to a smaller number (i.e. slower speed) and convert it back to `base64` and paste it back in our cookie.

Now we just reload the page and play the game with the nice slow elves ðŸ˜Š ![image](https://github.com/beta-j/SANS-Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2023/assets/60655500/e2c209ee-9eab-413b-aa0e-e8331cb9617a)
