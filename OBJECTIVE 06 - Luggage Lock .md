## PROCEDURE : ##

This one is a bit hard to describe here – but basically, it’s just a matter of following the instructions given by [Chris Elgee in his talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycM1hBSEyog).
Apply a little pressure on the unlock button (around 2 clicks) and turn the wheels one by one until they get stuck and that’s it.
