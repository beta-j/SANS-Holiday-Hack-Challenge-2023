# Ending Epilogue & Thanks #

After succesfully re-aiming the missile towards the sun, Jack Frost crashes his satellite right next to Rudolph’s Rest.  
Once I arrived there I was greeted by quite a sight – the crashed satellite was there sure enough along with two trolls, Santa and all 6 Geese A Lei’ing!

What a journey that was!  This was my sixth Holiday Hack Challenge and the fourth time I completed all of the objectives.
Massive Thanks to all the team at CounterHack for making my Holidays that much more interesting every year!
