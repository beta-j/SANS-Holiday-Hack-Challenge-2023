>A troll is blocking the present_engine from starting. Run the present_engine binary to retrieve this troll.

```~/workshop$ ls -a | grep 'present*'
present_engine
~/workshop$ ./present_engine
bash: ./present_engine: Permission denied
~/workshop$ chmod +x present_engine
~/workshop$ ./present_engine
troll.898906189498077
```

>Trolls have blown the fuses in /home/elf/workshop/electrical. cd into electrical and rename blown_fuse0 to fuse0.

```
~/workshop$ cd /home/elf/workshop/electrical/
~/workshop/electrical$ mv blown_fuse0 fuse0
```

>Now, make a symbolic link (symlink) named fuse1 that points to fuse0

`~/workshop/electrical$ ln -s fuse0 fuse1`

>Make a copy of fuse1 named fuse2.

`~/workshop/electrical$ cp fuse1 fuse2`

>We need to make sure trolls don't come back. Add the characters "TROLL_REPELLENT" into the file fuse2.

`~/workshop/electrical$ echo "TROLL_REPELLENT" >> fuse2`

>Find the troll somewhere in /opt/troll_den.
