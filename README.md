Readers with a strong background in Cyber-Security will probably want to skip through Objectives 1-12 and start off at [OBJECTIVE 13 - KQL Kraken Hunt](https://github.com/beta-j/SANS-Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2023/blob/main/OBJECTIVE%2013%20-%20KQL%20Kraken%20Hunt%20.md) 
Objectives tend to be more challenging as you progress.

This was my sixth time participating in the Holiday Hack Challenge and the fourth time I managed to complete all objectives.
