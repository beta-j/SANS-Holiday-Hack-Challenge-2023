## PROCEDURE : ##
This one is quite straightforward to tackle.  Armed with basic background knowledge of how `DMARC`, `DKIM`, and `SPF` work we can go through the mails in the inbox one-by-one.  The easiest ones to mark as Phishing are those where the header includes: `DMARC: Fail`.  The rest need a slightly closer look.  In fact, we can also find a few emails where the domain in the **From** field does not match with that in the **Return-Path** value of the header.  These are also clearly phishing attempts.

Ultimately, we end up with **10 confirmed phishing emails.**
