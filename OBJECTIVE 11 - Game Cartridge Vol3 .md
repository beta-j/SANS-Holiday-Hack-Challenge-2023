## PROCEDURE : ##

Just like what we did in [Game Cartridge Vol 1](OBJECTIVE%2009%20-%20Game%20Cartridge%20Vol%201%20.md), we can look at the source code to see a global constant defined as const `ROM_FILENAME = "rom/game.gb"`;  This tells us that the gameâ€™s ROM file can be downloaded from the `/rom/game.gb` directory at the following URL: [https://gamegosling.com/vol3-7bNwQKGBFNGQT1/rom/game.gb](https://gamegosling.com/vol3-7bNwQKGBFNGQT1/rom/game.gb)

Once we have the [ROM file](Assets/Vol3%20-%20game.gb) we can load into a GameBoy Emulator ([I used BGB for this](https://bgb.bircd.org/)) which lets us look at the values stored in the gameâ€™s memory and also allows us to save and load the gameâ€™s state making it a lot easier to get through the game.  

The [BGB website has an extremely useful guide](https://bgb.bircd.org/manual.html#cheats) for this bit.

BGB allows us to search for memory registers holding a specific value, then filter by those registers that have remained unchanged or by those registers that have increased or decreased in value.

My first instinct was to try and get to the end of the game whilst trying to figure out what memory registers are storing the value of the coins (we always could use more coins, right?).  The game ends at a particular point where elf needs to jump off a cliff into nothingness...surely there must be a way around this!

By following the [BGB cheat guide](https://bgb.bircd.org/manual.html#cheats) and after some trial and error I figured out that the coinsâ€™ value is being stored as follows:

Digit | Registers
---|---
Leftmost digit (representing hundreds) |	C160 and CB9E
Middle digit (representing tens) |		C12C and CB9C
Rightmost digit (representing units)|	C1F8 and CBA2

Now we can change and freeze the values of these 6 registers to `09` (to give ourselves **999 coins**) and play through the game saving states regularly to avoid being killed and having to start over.  

When we reach the end of the game we now see some floating platforms in the chasm â€“ Iâ€™m assuming these were conveniently created by a buffer overflow caused when fixing the registers to `09`.  We are now able to jump across the chasm using the floating platforms, talk to a hacker to get a passcode, give the passcode to ChatNPT who in turn allows us to move a large rock to get this objectives flag!  

**MUCH GLOOOOOOOOORYYY** ðŸ˜Š
